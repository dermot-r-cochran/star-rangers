// Canonical registry of storyline threads and the season numbers each one
// covers - see story-bible/story-bible-summary.md's "Narrative Structure -
// Multiple Independent Storylines" section for the concept this formalizes.
// Single source of truth, consumed both by the site's season/thread
// grouping (src/_data/storylineThreads.js re-exports STORYLINE_THREADS,
// .eleventy.js exposes threadForSeason as a template filter) and by
// deploy.conf's THREADS filter (lib/content-filter.js).
//
// `private: true` (optional, defaults falsy) marks a thread as opt-in only:
// lib/content-filter.js's isThreadIncluded hides every page belonging to it
// - its chapters (by season), any character/lore/codex/glossary/timeline
// entry tagged with its id, and its own /threads/<id>/ landing page - on
// EVERY build, including the unfiltered "full site" one, unless that
// build's own deploy.conf CHARACTERS/TOPICS/THREADS explicitly names the
// thread's id. This is the opposite of what an ordinary (non-private)
// thread's id does when named there: for those, THREADS just narrows an
// otherwise-full site down to a subset. Use `private: true` for a thread
// meant for exactly one domain (or a small set of them) rather than every
// production clone - e.g. church-space.site/.online's own storyline, kept
// out of sciencefiction.site, GitHub Pages, and every other clone by
// default.
//
// `homeDomain` (optional, private threads only) is the bare domain where
// this thread's pages DO live - the one clone that opts into it. It exists
// so the "Not included in this edition" placeholder (src/_includes/
// excluded.njk) can point a reader at a domain that actually has the page.
// A private thread's page is excluded on every OTHER build, including the
// default full-site build; without this the placeholder would send readers
// to sciencefiction.site (the default reference domain), which also excludes
// it - a self-referential loop, since that domain never opts the thread in
// either. With it, an excluded church-space page links to church-space.site
// instead. Ordinary (non-private) excluded pages have no homeDomain and keep
// pointing at DEFAULT_REFERENCE_DOMAIN, the full-site superset that has them.

// The bare domain of the full, unfiltered "reference" site - the superset a
// narrowed clone's excluded pages point back to. Every non-private page
// exists here, so it's the right target for anything excluded by ordinary
// CHARACTERS/TOPICS/THREADS narrowing; a private thread overrides it with
// its own homeDomain (see above), since this domain excludes it too.
