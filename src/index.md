  {#- The slideshow is per-edition (lib/editions.js) AND per-deploy: its cast is
      resolved against the FILTERED characters collection, so a narrowed clone
      (deploy.conf's CHARACTERS/TOPICS/THREADS) can drop some hero characters -
      or, if none of the edition's ids survive its filter, all of them. That
      last case used to render nothing at all, leaving the one page every reader
      lands on first with no image on it. The site's own fallback hero stands in
      instead; it is the same file this page already advertises as its
      og:image, so a card and the page now agree.

      `withImages` is what makes the count below honest, and it matters for
      more than tidiness: a hero character with no `image:` used to render an
      empty <img> requesting the characters DIRECTORY, and it counted toward
      --nN all the same, so the crossfade timed a slot for a slide that was
      never going to appear. Filtering before the count fixes both at once.

      Since 2026-08-29 the same filter also drops PLACEHOLDER-stamped
      portraits (the designed PORTRAIT PENDING cards), so the slideshow only
      ever shows finished images - on every domain. -#}

  {#- A card is a promise that the section behind it has something on it. On
      a narrowed edition that is not guaranteed: undercover-pets.com carries
      no lore at all and one glossary entry, and until 2026-09-01 its homepage
      offered "Map the layers of reality..." over a page that said "No lore
      articles published yet." Reference cards are shown only when the
