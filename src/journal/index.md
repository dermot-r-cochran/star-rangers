  This is out-of-character. Everything else on this site is Star Rangers' own record of itself — the Journal is
  Dermot R. Cochran's, about it: naming decisions, worldbuilding rationale, and the odd fragment of process worth
  keeping in public rather than only in a private notes file. If you're looking for the story, start with
  <a href="/star-rangers/seasons/">Seasons</a> instead.
