# Pages needing your own prose

Planning note (not built into the site — lives in `story-bible/` like the
other authorial notes). Built 2026-07-23 from git history: every content
file under `src/{seasons,lore,characters,codex,glossary,timeline}/` whose
**entire authorship history has no commit from Dermot Cochran / Avalon
Hope** — i.e. every word currently on the page was written by an AI tool
(the original Copilot bootstrap, or a later Claude Code session), and you
have never personally written or revised it.

This is the front-to-back list. A shorter, separate list —
`prose-needs-review.md` — covers pages you *did* write, that AI has since
edited and which may need a tone check.

## Flag first: Season 6 has chapters you may not know exist

`src/seasons/s06/` and `src/seasons/s07/` contain drafted chapters
(`s06e01c01/c02/c03.md`, `s07e01c01/c02/c03.md`, dated 2026-07-21) — entirely
AI-authored, and apparently written *after*
`story-bible/narrative-gaps-checklist.md` was last updated (2026-07-14),
which still says "zero chapters exist anywhere in `src/seasons/`" for
Season 6–7. That checklist is now stale on this point. Given Season 6–7 is
your climax ("The Last Stand"), this is worth a direct look before anything
else on this list — it may be draft material to keep as scaffolding, or it
may be further along than you want an AI tool taking a story this personal.

## Season chapters (actual narrative prose — highest priority)

- Season 0 (Founding Era): all of `s00/e01`, `s00/e02`, `s00/e03` (indexes + 6 chapters)
- Season 1: `s01/e00` (4 chapters, Elvira/Aldera prequel), `s01/e01` (2 ch),
  `s01/e02` (5 ch), `s01/e03/s01e03c02.md`
- Season 2: `s02/e01` (index + 3 chapters) — per the gaps checklist this
  season is "deliberately open," so confirm this drafted content is meant
  to exist at all
- Season 3: `s03/e01` (index + 2 chapters)
- Season 5: `s05/e02` (index + 2 chapters)
- Season 6: `s06/e01` (index + 3 chapters) — see flag above
- Season 7: `s07/e01` (index + 3 chapters) — see flag above
- Section indexes: `src/seasons/index.md`, and the `s00`/`s01` season indexes

## Characters (34 files + index)

`agent-barsik`, `bertram-ashcombe`, `brother-daire`, `brother-fintan`,
`bubochka`, `cormac-dubhghlas`, `dagny-voss`, `demelza-trevithick`,
`dorian-calloway`, `fergus-aonghas`, `idris-bryneth`, `ilsabet-marrowtide`,
`ilse-korvain`, `imogen-petrakis`, `isren-farrowkin`, `jeeves`, `kai-larsen`,
`lorien-the-wanderer`, `maren-solveig-krast`, `mira-of-brine`, `nessa`,
`niamh-o-ceallaigh`, `orla-shepherd`, `petra-voss`, `qiren-tal`,
`rhian-gwynne`, `rhiannon-ceridwen`, `rook-7`, `saint-aoife`, `sen`, `sohrel`,
`wendell-albercombe`, `zara-wayland`, plus `characters/index.md`.

Note the overlap with the image audit: `ilse-korvain`, `orla-shepherd`,
`maren-solveig-krast` also had wrong-content portraits flagged there — these
three characters have never had either their prose or their image
touched/chosen by you.

## Lore (36 files + index)

`arilon`, `boundary-zones`, `cerebraun`, `chthonari`, `cnoc-na-mbeach`,
`concordant-membranes`, `dryadic-trees`, `eden-ring-rail`,
`ensemble-multiverse`, `federation-of-sentient-beings`, `five-layers`,
`formation-of-star-rangers`, `frontier-transformation-protocols`,
`galactic-stardate`, `membrane-shadows`, `military-space-command`,
`mnemari`, `monasteries-of-mars`, `planetary-liaisons-and-recruiters`,
`planets/prismere`, `planets/saltmere`, `planets/sentinel`,
`planets/verdance`, `post-eleven-dimensional-manifold`,
`post-teleport-ascension-stress-disorder`, `prismeri`,
`quantum-space-harmonics`, `saint-aoife`, `solar-time-and-local-calendars`,
`star-rangers-command-hierarchy`, `star-rangers-science-corps`,
`teleportation-limitations`, `universal-cosmic-stardate`,
`universes/tir-tairngire`, `year-zero`, plus `lore/index.md`.

Three of these (`five-layers`, `formation-of-star-rangers`,
`frontier-transformation-protocols`) are also the three lore pages with the
scrambled image/alt-text bug from the image audit — worth tackling image and
prose together on those three.

image from the audit), `telling-the-bees-at-cnoc-na-mbeach`,
