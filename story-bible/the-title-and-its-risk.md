# The title, and the one risk still open

**Status: RESOLVED, 4 August 2026.** The risk this file was tracking ended the
way its own test predicted it might: **Drithane is retired as the work's
title, displaced by Fian Ilchruinne** — Dermot's call, stated as "Drithane was
not unique enough," which is the Dithane silent-correction problem below
conceded early rather than waited out. The September test is **moot**. The
sections below are kept as the record of how the decision was reached; read
them as history, not as open work.

## Resolution (4 August 2026)

- **The work's title is Fian Ilchruinne** — the setting umbrella (adopted
  3 August) now does double duty as the work's title; the two naming tiers
  have collapsed into one name. Everything the umbrella adoption settled
  still holds, above all: **Fian-ilchruinne stays out of lore, glossary and
  narrative** — never used in story, never defined in-world.
- **The retitle sweep ran the same day**: README, CLAUDE.md,
  CONTENT-LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, FORKING.md, package.json, the
  homepage/about/official/forking pages, `site.js` (description and OG
  author), the four edition taglines in `lib/editions.js`, the giscus
  welcome posts, and the theme labels. The ~12 lore/glossary pages that said
  "the Drithane multiverse/universe/canon" as editorial framing now say
  **"the Grand Ensemble Multiverse"** (the canon in-universe term) or
  neutral phrasing — deliberately *not* Fian-ilchruinne, per the
  outside-the-story rule above.
- **"Drithane" is now a free name, reserved for possible in-universe reuse**
  — a planet or a character, at Dermot's choosing. It was never used
  in-story and never defined in-world, so canon has no claims on it; the
  Dithane search collision that killed it as a *title* is irrelevant to an
  in-universe name (nobody finds the site by searching a planet). The
  *drithle* (spark, glimmer) etymology and the attested Irish forms below
  (*drithleog*, *drithlín*, *drithleanna*) remain good material for that
  reuse. Until Dermot names it into canon, it means nothing in-world.
  **Exercised the same day:** Dermot chose the planet, and
  `src/lore/planets/drithane.md` drafts it — the fifth documented Celtic
  Union charter world (filling one of the two by-name-only slots the
  Union's Member Worlds section always held open), a cold clear-skied
  world in the Bríd System named in-world for the *drithle*: silent
  sparks crossing its sky twice an orbit as the planet passes through a
  debris band. The retired title becomes the planet's name by the same
  root, and the naming journey stays out-of-universe where it always was.
- **drithane.com was never purchased** (the deferral below did its job), so
  there is no domain to unwind. The journal entries recording the Drithane
  chapter of the naming journey stay as published history.

---

## Settled (as of 1 August 2026; title since displaced — see Resolution above)

The work was retitled **Drithane**. From the Irish *drithle* — a spark, a
glimmer — and it happens to look like *drift*, which was not planned and was
being kept.

It means **nothing in-story**. No character says it, it is not in the glossary,
and it is not going in. A title that stays outside the story gets to be about all
of it; defining *Drithane* in-world would narrow it to one thing.

The **Star Rangers keep their name** as the in-universe corps. The collision was
on a title; an organisation inside a story is not one, and every substitute
tested was equally occupied.

---

## Open: the Dithane collision

**Found 1 August 2026, the day after the rename.**

Google currently **silently corrects** a search for *Drithane* to **Dithane** — a
mancozeb fungicide brand from UPL and Corteva, EPA-registered, sold globally for
over fifty years. It is **one character away**: delete the `r`.

**Found 2 August 2026: a second edit-distance-1 neighbour.** **Drythane**
(`i`→`y`) is a live polyurethane waterproofing brand — a 100%-solids coating
system from Amchem Products, with both drythane.com and drythane.in active. So
the title sits one edit from two chemical-industry brands on opposite sides,
and the reason is structural: **"-thane" is the polyurethane/alkane chemical
suffix** (methane, ethane, urethane, Dithane, Drythane). Any name keeping that
tail stays in the neighbourhood. A replacement, if one is ever needed, must
change the *ending*, not the front of the word.

**Why it is probably temporary.** Search engines correct to a high-frequency term
when the queried string has near-zero index presence. Drithane had none: the site
went live under the name that day. Statistically, at that moment, it *was* a typo
for Dithane. As the word accumulates genuine occurrences — the site, the journal
entry, the repo, the changelog — engines normally stop correcting and switch to
*showing results for Drithane, did you mean Dithane?*

**Why it might not be.** An edit-distance-1 neighbour of a high-volume commercial
term imposes a permanent tax. Some proportion of searchers get diverted or
mistype, and that never fully goes away.

### The test, and the date

**Re-test around mid-September 2026.** The distinction is sharp and worth holding
to exactly:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Silent correction** — results for Dithane, Drithane not offered | Real problem. Worth renaming. |
| **Suggestion** — results for Drithane, *did you mean Dithane?* | Fine. Keep the name. |

Also check **Search Console → Performance → Queries** for `drithane` impressions.
That is an earlier and better signal than eyeballing a search box.

### If the test goes badly

**Fallback vetting done 2–3 August 2026** (exact-phrase search per candidate,
plus near-homograph checks — the two lessons below, actually applied this
time). Results, so none of it is re-walked:

- **The Irish first: *drithleán* is not attested.** The forms the dictionaries
  actually give for *drithle* are the diminutives **drithleog** and
  **drithlín**, and the plural *drithleanna*. An earlier version of this note
  proposed *drithleán* as "the Irish diminutive"; treat any use of *Drithlean*
  as a coinage in the style of one, not a real word.
- **Drithlean** — viable but weakened. The exact string is unoccupied (only
  Gaelic dictionary hits), it exits the -thane tail, and it is 4 edits from
  Dithane and 4 from Drythane (the "three edits" a previous version of this
  note claimed was an undercount). But its h-dropped neighbourhood has
  distance-2 clutter — *Drilean* (a small Brazilian leather-goods brand on
  Instagram) and *Dritlein* (an NFL player's surname). Neither is a
  high-volume term with autocorrect gravity, so this fails no test the note
  sets; it is just muddier than it first looked, and the Irish behind it is
  invented.
- **Drithleog** — dead. *An Drithleog* ("The Spark") was a republican prison
  newsletter (Derry Jail 1943, revived in the 1970s USA), and it is an ability
  name in the game *Another Eden*. Same class of hit that killed Caldreth and
  Eirath.
- **Overfold** (added 3 August 2026) — a different kind of candidate: not
  a coinage but a real dictionary word (OED 1883, geology — an overturned
  fold, strata forced past 90° so younger rock lies beneath older; after
  German *Überfaltung*), and already a canon glossary term (the
  Fellowship's contemplative name for boundary-zone Etheric phenomena).
  Scoring against the three gates: exact match *not* empty but occupied
  only by vocabulary — no work, brand or product holds it, the softest
  failure of any candidate vetted; edit distance — **watch *overload***,
  2 edits away and high-volume, mitigated by "overfold" being a real
  indexed word (engines suggest rather than silently correct dictionary
  words), but an early "did you mean overload" tax is plausible; **radio
  test — passes cleanly, the only candidate on this shelf that does.**
  One obvious spelling, recoverable from sound. The geology collision is
  resonant rather than embarrassing — layers pressed over layers — and
  reads as deliberate scientific loan-vocabulary, like "membrane".
  Placement: **title tier, not umbrella.** In-world the Overfold is one
  tradition's term for one phenomenon, so "the Overfold universe" would
  name the continuity after the Fellowship's lens on boundaries —
  narrower than GEM, which names everything. As a *title* it is resonant
  rather than definitional (folds run through the cosmology from transit
  to Metafold to *Protectors of the Fold*), which is the side of the
  title-stays-outside-the-story line the settled exceptions live on. It
  does breach the strict form of that rule — it is a defined in-story
  term — so adopting it would be a knowing exception, not an oversight.
- **Drithlin** — **strongest coinage.** Attested Irish (*drithlín* — a
  tingle, a thrill of joy: still on-theme), 4 edits from Dithane and 4 from
  Drythane, ends in "-lin" rather than "-thane". Exact-phrase search returns
  only Irish dictionary entries, and the h-dropped neighbour *dritlean/dritlin*
  is also unoccupied — the nearest entities are bare "Drit" (a tablet, an FMEA
  software product, a music act), all shorter strings with no pull on an
  8-letter query. The only nearby chemical is Dithranol (a psoriasis drug) at
  a comfortable distance. Passes both the exact-match test and the
  near-homograph test that Drithane itself failed.

Do not rename twice on a pre-indexing result. The journal entry, the 1.11.0
release, the tags and any domain would all have to move. This vetting sharpens
the fallback; the September test still decides whether a fallback is needed.

### The naming tiers, and the umbrella (3 August 2026)

Three tiers, three different rules — keeping them distinct is what this
week's vetting kept converging on:

- **Title of the work** — out-of-story word, strict vetting regime below.
  *Drithane*, pending the September test. If a replacement single word is
  ever hunted, it must pass **three gates**, not one: empty exact match;
  edit distance ≥2 (ideally 3) from any high-volume term; and the **radio
  test** — the spelling must be recoverable from sound alone. Drithane
  fails the third quietly: *Drithane* and *Drythane* are homophones, so a
  spoken recommendation can land a typed search on the waterproofing brand
  with no autocorrect involved. A clean single word beats everything; a
  clean multi-word phrase beats a compromised single word, and passes the
  radio test almost automatically.
- **Setting umbrella** — the Cosmere-style name for the whole continuity.
  **ADOPTED (final, 3 August 2026): Fian-ilchruinne** — succeeding
  *Grand Ensemble Multiverse*, which was adopted as the working umbrella
  earlier the same day, explicitly interim until a shorter word was
  found; Fian-ilchruinne is that word, and Dermot adopted it
  deliberately, the sit-with-it advice noted and waived.
  **The rationale, stated by Dermot at adoption:** the name is **never
  used in story** — no character says it, no lore page defines it — so
  it satisfies the original title-tier principle ("a name that stays
  outside the story gets to be about all of it") rather than needing
  the umbrella tier's in-world exemption. From outside, it *points*
  without quoting: at the Star Rangers (*fian*, the sworn band), the
  Celtic Union and Tissadelle's Irish ancestry (the language itself),
  the Grand Ensemble Multiverse (*ilchruinne*), and the corpus's wider
  Irish register (Tír na nÓg, Sí Gaoithe, *drithle*). Gesturing, not
  defining — which is what distinguishes it from Overfold (a defined
  in-story term, usable only as a knowing exception) and from GEM
  itself (canon vocabulary). Keep it that way: **do not introduce
  Fian-ilchruinne into lore, glossary, or narrative** — its
  outside-the-story position is a property worth protecting, and the
  moment a page defines it, it narrows. Two scope
  boundaries on the adoption: (a) **the lore is untouched** — "Grand
  Ensemble Multiverse" remains the canon in-universe name of the
  multiverse (`src/lore/ensemble-multiverse.md`); Fian-ilchruinne is the
  front-of-house umbrella brand, not a terminology change, and no
  glossary migration is implied. (b) **Site surfacing — decided later
  the same day, in two steps**: `SITE_TITLE`'s repo default is
  **"Fian-ilchruinne"** (settled hyphenated form, superseding the "Grand
  Ensemble Multiverse" tab title #278 shipped for a few hours), and
  `SITE_NAME`'s repo default is **"Fian Ilchruinne"** — the spaced,
  capitalised **display variant** Dermot chose for on-page branding
  (header logo, footer, homepage `<h1>`), replacing "Drithane" there.
  That display form is a deliberate variant of the settled spelling, for
  the name's on-page face only — the hyphenated form remains canonical
  everywhere the word is *referred to*. Drithane thereby leaves the
  default header: the work's title now reaches the default build via
  the meta description and OG author. The description deliberately
  keeps "…of the Grand Ensemble Multiverse…" — the canon in-universe
  name; the description speaks in-world, the chrome speaks
  front-of-house. Per-edition overrides are unaffected. **Domain (decided 3 August 2026): go
  for it.** Register BOTH forms — `fianilchruinne.com` (fused: what
  people will actually type, since typed domains drop hyphens) and
  `fian-ilchruinne.com` (matching the settled spelling) — with one
  301-redirecting to the other; fused as primary is the
  radio-test-consistent choice. The
  drithane.com-deferral logic does NOT apply here — that deferral
  existed to keep the September title test unbiased, and the umbrella
  has no pending test.
  **PURCHASED, 3 August 2026:** `fianilchruinne.com` is registered and
  resolving (to 31.22.4.67 as of purchase day). Later the same day the
  full protective fleet followed: **fian-ilchruinne.com** (the
  hyphenated settled spelling — resolving), plus
  **fianilchruinne .site / .space / .online / .net** (registered per
  Dermot, DNS still propagating at time of recording) — all wired in
  cPanel as aliases of fianilchruinne.com. **fianilchruinne.ie is not
  applied for yet** — the open item if the Irish flag is ever wanted;
  Dermot qualifies for .ie. **Wiring is the open decision, not
  yet made:** whether fianilchruinne.com becomes (a) an alias of
  sciencefiction.site (serving its docroot, self-canonical consolidates
  to the target — the star-rangers.space pattern), or (b) the default
  edition's canonical domain, *replacing* sciencefiction.site as the
  unbranded full site's identity — the strong case sketched for
  drithane.com before the retitle, transferred here. (b) is a
  live-domain identity change: registry edit in `lib/editions.js`
  (draft-and-stop), a cPanel clone/addon with its own deploy.conf, and
  a canonical/redirect plan for sciencefiction.site's existing index
  presence. Do neither by default; each is its own instruction.
  **DECIDED, 3 August 2026: (b) — canonical.** The path here had a
  kink worth recording: (a) was chosen first and wired for about an
  hour (registry comment, cPanel alias), then Dermot corrected it —
  "my mistake, fianilchruinne.com is now the canonical edition" — and
  the alias arrangement was reworked unmerged. Final state:
  fianilchruinne.com is the default edition's canonical address,
  first in its `domains` list in `lib/editions.js`;
  `DEFAULT_REFERENCE_DOMAIN` (excluded-page placeholders), the deploy
  fallbacks, the Official Editions page, and the README all name it;
  sciencefiction.site stays a registered domain of the same edition
  at its original address, consolidating to the canonical once the
  clone redeploys. **Deployed 3 August 2026:** fianilchruinne.com
  serves from its own new cPanel account (its own clone,
  `DOMAIN=fianilchruinne.com`, explicit ADMIN_EMAIL on a working
  address) — live and self-canonical after a first-deploy saga worth
  its scars: a "system cannot deploy" git-state blocker cured by
  recreating the clone, and the ADMIN_EMAIL-forwarder lesson now
  hardened into the deploy script.
  **Two open loose ends, recorded 3 August 2026, neither urgent:**
  (1) **sciencefiction.site's posture.** Both domains currently serve
  the full site and each self-canonicalises — duplicate content
  competing in search. Fix is one of: (a) set the sciencefiction.site clone's
  deploy.conf to `DOMAIN=fianilchruinne.com`, so pages served at the
  old address carry canonicals naming the new one (consolidation
  while still serving pages), or (b) a cPanel 301 redirect from
  sciencefiction.site to fianilchruinne.com — the stronger signal for
  transferring the old domain's index equity, and what SEO orthodoxy
  picks. Dermot's call; do neither by default.
  (2) **Search Console for fianilchruinne.com** — claim the property
  and submit the sitemap. The 1.12.0 Safe Browsing saga proved
  claiming early pays, and the September title re-test reads better
  with Search Console data flowing for the new canonical too.
  **Why loose end (1) applies here and not to the other edition
  families** (asked and answered 2026-08-03): the duplication is the
  same phenomenon everywhere — the four fellowshipoflight TLDs, the
  two starquest and two church-space domains, and GitHub Pages all
  serve identical builds that each self-canonicalise, and search
  engines quietly elect one winner per family on their own. That is
  tolerable there because no equity is at stake and nobody cares which
  TLD wins; it stopped being tolerable for
  sciencefiction.site → fianilchruinne.com because that pair has a
  *designated* winner and real accumulated index equity to transfer.
  Degree, not kind. If the families are ever tidied the same way, the
  recipe is: pick one primary per family (fellowshipoflight.org,
  starquest.site), convert the rest to cPanel aliases of it — the
  mechanism star-rangers.space/star-rangers.site already use — and
  update the registry's ALIAS DOMAINS block to match. Indefinitely
  deferrable. The "title stays outside the story" rule
  does not bind here — an umbrella naming the cosmology in-world is the
  established pattern — and the full phrase is unowned; its neighbours
  (grand canonical ensemble, Tegmark's ensemble multiverse) read as
  intended hard-SF register, not confusion. Do not coin variants ("Grand
  Ensemble Universe"): one canon form. Its known cost, accepted at
  adoption: it names the stage, not the corps — and the work is as much
  about the Star Rangers. Candidates to shorten to, when the time comes:
  the title itself ("the Drithane universe") if it survives September, or
  a new find.
  **On the shelf for that succession (recorded 3 August 2026):
  Fian-ilchruinne** — *fian* (the warrior-band, the Fianna) + *ilchruinne*
  (the real modern Irish word for multiverse): literally "the multiverse
  Fianna", i.e. Rangers of the Grand Ensemble Multiverse compressed into
  one Irish word. The only candidate of the August vetting that unites
  corps and stage in a single term, repairing GEM's stage-not-corps cost,
  and shorter than GEM as the interim decision asked. Scoring: exact
  match empty (nothing anywhere; nearest neighbours are the Fianna
  themselves); no high-volume edit-distance neighbour, so no autocorrect
  predator — once indexed, an exact search is a fortress; **radio test —
  hardest fail of any candidate vetted**, thirteen letters of Irish
  orthography no anglophone can spell from sound, survivable only at
  this tier because an umbrella is navigated by link and branding rather
  than by ear, with *Drithane* as the radio-friendly front door covering
  for it. Spelling is settled as **Fian-ilchruinne** (final, decided by
  Dermot, 3 August 2026): Old Irish *fian-*, hyphen, *ilchruinne* —
  chosen as the most elegant of the forms considered. The full path, so
  it isn't re-walked: *Fianilchruine* (misspelled *cruinne*) →
  *Fianilchruinne* (fused, archaic *fían-*) → *Fiannilchruinne* (fused,
  modern *fiann-*, briefly settled) → **Fian-ilchruinne** (final: the
  hyphen shows the seam, and the archaic *fian-* matches the word's
  older register throughout). The fused forms were exact-phrase vetted
  empty; hyphenation changes no ownership — hyphenated and fused read
  as the same unowned string to search.
  **Irish verified 3 August 2026** (via dictionary content in search
  snippets; teanglann.ie and tearma.ie are blocked from the session
  environment): *cruinne* ✓ (f., double n, "universe/globe", from
  *cruinn* "round"); *il-* + lenition → *ilchruinne* ✓ well-formed and
  genuinely attested as Irish for "multiverse"; the vowel-initial
  junction needs no mutation, so a hyphen (*Fian-ilchruinne*) is
  optional clarity, not a requirement. Two points arose in verification,
  both since resolved by Dermot: (1) the **modern** headword is *fiann*
  (f., gs. *féinne*, pl. *fianna*) — *fían* is the Old Irish spelling.
  **Resolved finally: archaic *fian-* kept, with the hyphen** — the
  modern *fiann-* was briefly chosen and then set aside for elegance;
  the older-register consistency (archaic *fian-* front,
  superseded-but-preferred *ilchruinne* behind) carried the day, and
  the genitive-phrase escape (*Fiann na hIlchruinne*) stays passed
  over. (2) **resolved by Dermot's direct check, 3 August 2026**:
  téarma.ie does list *ilchruinne* (recognized, so the base is real
  attested Irish) but marks it **superseded**, and Dermot judged the
  current replacement term less elegant and chose to keep *ilchruinne*
  anyway. Recorded as a deliberate authorial choice, not an oversight —
  coining from the older form that sounds right over the current one
  that doesn't is a legitimate move. The compound itself is in no
  database, which is the correct state for a coinage: a compound the
  terminology database already held would be a word someone else owns.
  With both spelling questions closed by decision — archaic *fian-* on
  the front, superseded-but-preferred *ilchruinne* behind it, hyphen at
  the seam — the word's file is complete: **Fian-ilchruinne**, unique,
  well-formed, one consistently older-register word, every choice made
  with eyes open. **Adopted 3 August 2026** — the deliberate yes was
  given the same day, sit-with-it advice noted and waived; see the
  umbrella bullet above for the adoption's scope and the domain
  decision. A corps-flavoured umbrella ("Star Rangers Universe") stays
  off the table — the corps keeps its name inside the fiction, and an
  umbrella is front-of-house, so that would quietly reverse the
  2026-08-01 retitle. Ranger emphasis belongs one tier down, in the
  tagline: *The Edges Hold* is already the corps' phrase, and **Rangers
  of the Grand Ensemble Multiverse** is vetted available as a subtitle
  (collision-free by inheritance from GEM; unites corps and stage;
  Golden-Age-serial register, warmer than the house voice — a deliberate
  choice if used; too long to be the spoken handle, which stays the
  title).
  **Scope of the adoption (revised later on 3 August 2026 — supersedes
  the planning-tier-only reading briefly recorded here):** GEM is now
  front-of-house by default. `SITE_TITLE`'s repo default is **"Grand
  Ensemble Multiverse"** (the browser-tab brand) and the default meta
  description reads "…an interactive science-fantasy novel *of the Grand
  Ensemble Multiverse*…" (`src/_data/site.js`). `SITE_NAME` — the header
  and footer brand — stays **"Drithane"**: the header carries the work's
  title, the tab carries the setting. Clones still override both via
  `deploy.conf`/`lib/editions.js`, so branded editions are unaffected
  unless they inherit the default.
- **Tagline/descriptor** — three-word out-of-story phrases, cheap to vet
  (one exact-phrase search; no autocorrect gravity at three words).
  Vetted available 3 August 2026: *Sparks Between Worlds* (unowned; busy
  generic-fantasy neighbourhood), *The Edges Hold* (unowned; one indie
  album permutation-neighbour, *Hold the Edges*), *Chorus of Worlds*
  (one art print). None adopted; recorded so they aren't re-vetted.

### Domain, deliberately deferred

No `drithane` domain has been bought, and that is a decision rather than an
oversight: owning it would bias the September test toward keeping the name.
`sciencefiction.site` is canonical, live, and sufficient meanwhile.

If the name survives, the case for **drithane.com** is strong — not as a mirror
or a redirect, but as the eventual replacement for `sciencefiction.site` in the
*default* edition, which `lib/editions.js` already labels "Drithane (unbranded
full site)". The branded editions — StarQuest, Church Space, Fellowship of Light,
Undercover Pets — are correctly named for their framings and need nothing.

---

## The vetting lesson, for whoever names the next thing

First, the scope of the regime below: **it applies to titles, domains and
front-of-house branding — not to in-universe vocabulary.** The note already
draws this line for Star Rangers ("the collision was on a title; an
organisation inside a story is not one"), and a sweep on 3 August 2026
confirmed it generalises: *Levril* is an Italian intimate-hygiene product
line (Horus Salus) and, separately, a character in an unrelated Fandom
fiction — "The Fellowship of the Light of Christ" wiki — whose universe also
independently contains a *Frenar*; *frenat* is the everyday Catalan word for
"braked" plus an Aragonese water company; *Kieme* is the ordinary German noun
for "gill". None of that matters, and chasing term-level uniqueness would be
chasing the unattainable — every pronounceable coinage is a word somewhere or
a small brand somewhere else (the invented-name graveyard below proved the
same thing from the other side). A title is the front door and gets searched
bare, so it needs edit-distance safety from high-volume terms. A term is met
and searched in context, where a foreign gel or a fish organ is no
competition. The term-level bar is only: no *high-volume or embarrassing*
homograph, no trademark exposure, and instant disambiguation in context.

For the title tier, two failures, both worth avoiding deliberately.

**Search each candidate individually, as an exact phrase.** A combined `"A" OR
"B"` query reports on the loudest member of the set and hides the rest. Two names
were cleared this way and both were already taken — *Slipwave* (a game, a surf
brand, a seismology term) and *Worldwrights* (a novel by Max Grant, an AI
tabletop-tools company, a podcast).

**Test for near-homographs, not just exact matches.** This is the failure that
produced the Dithane problem. Checking "does another work hold this name" and "is
the exact string unique" is not enough — a name one edit from a high-volume
commercial term gets autocorrected away regardless of how unique it is. The
warning was visible and misread: searches for *Drithane* returned Drimane,
Dristan, Drano and Draethen, and a dense phonetic neighbourhood was taken as
evidence of cleanliness rather than of risk.

**The graveyard**, so it is not re-walked: *Cosmic Drift* (music acts),
*Five Layers* (collision-free but buried under the OSI model, software
architecture, skin anatomy and yoga), *Star Wardens* (a D&D subclass, a Warhammer
40,000 chapter, Jason McCuiston's *The Last Star Warden*), *Charter Wardens*
(municipal election officials, a New Jersey fishing charter), and the invented
*Caldreth*, *Eirath* and *Aveldrin*, all three already in World of Warcraft,
Final Fantasy XIV, Forgotten Realms and World Anvil.

Added 3 August 2026, from vetting the *drift-* direction as a Drithane
variant: ***Drifthane* / *Driftane* / *Driptane*** — the whole cluster is
dead. *Driftane* is an active e-liquids/e-cigarette brand (driftaneplaza.com)
and an ambient-music YouTube channel (@driftane); *Driptane* is a
pharmaceutical carried on multiple drug-information sites; *Drifthane* would
sit one edit from the first, two from the second, and still end in the
"-thane" chemical suffix that produced the Dithane and Drythane collisions in
the first place. The front of the word (*dri-*, *drif-*, *drit-*) is a dense
commercial and pharmaceutical phonetic cluster; the tail is a chemical suffix;
a workable variant keeps the *drithle* root and changes the tail.

---

## Checked and kept, so it is not re-litigated

Names below were run through the same collision checks as the graveyard's and
**deliberately kept**. The graveyard records what failed; this records what
passed and why — a name re-questioned without new evidence should be answered
from here.

**Kieme** — checked 4 August 2026, prompted by the Drithane retirement; kept.
The collisions found, in full: German ***die Kieme* = "gill"** (the fish
organ — a common noun in a major language, confirmed across Collins,
Cambridge, Wiktionary and Langenscheidt); a rare surname/given name (fewer
than five a year per names.org); Lithuanian *kieme*, locative of *kiemas*,
"in the yard"; and **no brand, product or trademark** — the nearest commercial
neighbour is *Kemei*, a Chinese grooming-appliance brand with a different
spelling that brand-flavoured searches drift toward, while a plain search for
*Kieme* returns German dictionary entries rather than silently correcting
away. Why none of it clears the bar: the Dithane failure mode was a **title**
— a front-of-house string whose whole job is discoverability — being silently
replaced in results by a commercial term. Kieme is an in-universe glossary
term with zero discoverability burden; readers reach it through the site,
never through a search engine (the same logic that frees Drithane for
in-universe reuse). A cosmological tier a German reader parses as "gill" is
mildly comic, not vulgar or tonally destructive, and common-noun homographs
in *some* language are near-unavoidable in invented naming. Against that, the
rename cost is steep: second tier of the Cosmic Cascade, morphologically
paired with Conseleme via the *-eme* ruler-marker etymology the glossary
entry itself analyses, one completed migration already behind it (Holy
Triumvirate → Kieme), and load-bearing in the church-space doctrinal
material. Verdict: **keep**; revisit only if a *brand* named Kieme appears or
a German-market edition ever becomes front-of-house.
